<h1>La Nivernaise</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
La Nivernaise or just Nivernaise (also known as Napoleon's Flank) is an older
version of <a href="tournament.html">Tournament</a>. It is played exactly as
Tournament except the six columns of four cards each are just piles with only
their top cards exposed. Here, the reserve is the "flank" while the piles are
the "line."
