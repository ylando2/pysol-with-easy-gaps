<h1>Agnes</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Agnes is a solitaire card game which is a variant of the very popular game
Klondike. It is similar to the latter except on how the stock is dealt.
<p>
Dealing the first 28 cards onto the tableau is a lot like in Klondike. Then a
card is placed in the first of the four foundations. This card will be the
first card of that foundation and all other cards with the same rank should be
placed at the other three foundations.
<p>
Seven cards are then dealt in a row either above or below the tableau. This
will act as the reserve. The cards in the reserve are available for play.
<p>
Playing the game is a lot like Klondike except that any gaps are filled in by
a card a rank lower than the first card of the foundation. For instance, if
the first card of each foundation is a 10, gaps are only filled by 9s.
Foundations are built up by suit, while the columns on the tableau are built
down in alternating colors, wrapping from Ace to King if necessary. When play
is no longer possible on the tableau, any card on the reserve can be used to
continue the game. Gaps in the reserve are not filled until a new set is
dealt.
<p>
If the game cannot continue even from the reserve, a new set of seven cards is
dealt from the stock to the reserve. The stock is good for two deals on the
reserve with two cards left over. So after the third new deal and no more
moves possible, the two left over cards are dealt as if they each have a
reserve pile on their own.
<p>
The game is won when all cards have made their way to the foundations.
<p>
There are two versions of the game of Agnes. The one described above is called
Agnes Bernauer. In another version called Agnes Sorel (no connection to the
woman with the same name), the game is played the same way except the cards in
the tableau are built down by color, i.e. Red suits on red, black suits on
black. Furthermore, in Agnes Sorel, spaces are not filled. David Parlett is
said to have given these two versions their separate names.
