<h1>King Albert</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
King Albert is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is
said to be named after King Albert of Belgium the first. It is also the best
known of the three games that are each called Idiot's Delight because of the
low chance of winning the game (the other two are Aces Up and Perpetual
Motion).
<p>
The aim of the game, like many solitaire games, is to release the aces to the
foundations and built each of them up by suit to Kings.
<p>
First, the cards are deal into nine columns in such a way that the first
column contains nine cards, the second having eight cards, the third seven,
and so on until the ninth column having a single card. The seven left over
cards form the reserve, sometimes known as "the Belgian Reserve."
<p>
Building on the tableau is down by alternating colors and only one card can be
moved at a time. Only the top card of each column and all cards in the reserve
are available for play. Furthermore, an empty column can be filled with any
available card.
<p>
Once an ace is released, it can be built upon immediately.
<p>
The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. But achieveing this
is difficult as one in only ten games can be won, hence the alternate name
of <i>Idiot's Delight</i>.
