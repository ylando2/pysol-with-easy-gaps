<h1>Shamrocks</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Shamrocks is a solitaire game akin to <a href="labellelucie.html">La Belle
Lucie</a>. The object is the same as the latter: move the cards into the
foundations.
<p>
The game is layout out as in La Belle Lucie: seventeen piles of three cards
are placed on the tableau with one card counting as an eighteenth. Any card
that can be moved to the foundations should be moved and built up by suit
(starting from the ace). The top card of each pile can be used for play and
once a pile is empty, it cannot be refilled.
<p>
But its similarity to La Belle Lucie ends there. Before the game begins, each
King which is on top or middle of its respective pile is placed underneath.
(Morehead and Mott-Smith's rules to the game specifically states that a King
that is on top of a lower-ranked card of the same suit should be placed under
that lower-ranked card, no matter what else in its pile.) To play on the
tableau, a card can be placed over a card that is one rank higher or lower,
regardless of suit (a <b>6</b><img src="../images/s.gif"> can be placed on a
<b>7</b><img src="../images/c.gif"> or a <b>5</b><img src="../images/d.gif">).
However, each pile can hold no more than three cards at a time; thus no card
can be placed on a pile with three cards.
<p>
The game is won when all of the cards have been moved to the foundations.
