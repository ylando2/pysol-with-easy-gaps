<h3>Quick description</h3>
Similar to <a href="braid.html">Braid</a>
played with two Mughal
<a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a>
decks.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Braid.  In this variation there are two Braid
stacks that each have their own set of Braid reserve stacks.  The
game lay out starts with the sixteen foundations in the outer most columns.
The next two columns inwards are the eight Braid reserves.  Then there
are two columns with four general reserves each.  The inner most two
columns are the two Braid stacks.  Each Braid starts with sixteen cards.
When one of the Braid reserves becomes open the card at the top of the
corresponding Braid will be moved there.  When all the cards from one
of the Braids are removed a card from the other Braid will be used.
<p>
The game is named after the reputed inventor of a twelve suited Ganjifa
deck of singular splendor.  It was engraved on ivory and hand painted
by court artisans.  No cards from this pack are known to still exist.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the rows that will play when the correct card turns
over from the talon.  This game type requires careful strategy to win.
