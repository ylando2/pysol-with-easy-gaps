with two Hanafuda decks.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Refer to the description of the deal in Lara's Game.  The difference
is the use of two Hanafuda decks instead of two 52 card standard decks
When a first rank card is dealt to the rows two cards are dealt to the talon.
There are twelve first rank cards in a Hanafuda deck.  There are 8 rows
in this Lara's game version.  Cards are dealt to all eight rows based on
their rank and which deck they are from.  The decks are shuffled together
on the talon.
<p>
The foundations take two complete rounds of a suit.  After the last card
of the first round is played to a foundation the first card of the second
round will play.
