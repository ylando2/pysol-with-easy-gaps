<h3>Object</h3>

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank in "alternate" colors.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in rank in alternate colors.  The
Dashavatara Ganjifa deck has ten suits and each suit has it's own color.
This makes it a bit problematic at times knowing which colors are alternate.
If a card of one suit doesn't play in a spot, try a different card of the
same rank.  The foundations build up in rank by suit starting with the Ace.
The cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  There is no redeal.  Only
the Mirs (Kings) may be played on an empty row.  Cards may be played from the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
The waste stack will be the biggest problem area.  Play from it first.
