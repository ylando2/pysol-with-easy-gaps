<h1>Little Easy</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to
<a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>.
The rows build down by rank in the same suit.  The foundations
build with cards of the same rank in suit order.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rows build from first rank to fourth rank by suit.  The foundations
build in ascending suit order from Pine to Phoenix by rank.  The third
and fourth rank (trash) cards are not interchangeable on the tableau.
Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time and there is no limit to
the number of redeals.  Cards may not be played from the foundations.
Only first rank cards may be played on an empty row.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Disable auto drop and build on the rows until all cards are face up.
These games may be easy by name and easy to play but they're not easy
to win.
