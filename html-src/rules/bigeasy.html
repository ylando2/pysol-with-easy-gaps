<h1>Big Easy</h1>
Hanafuda type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
This is a double deck version of
<a href="littleeasy.html">Little Easy</a>.
The rows build down by rank in the same suit.  The foundations
build with cards of the same rank in suit order.  Only first rank
cards may be played on an empty row.

<h3>Rules</h3>
The rules are the same as in
<a href="littleeasy.html">Little Easy</a>.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Disable auto drop and build on the rows until all cards are face up.
These games may be easy by name and easy to play but they're not easy
to win.
