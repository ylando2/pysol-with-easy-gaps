<h1>Japanese Garden</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
This is a <a href="fan.html">Fan</a>
type game adapted to the Hanafuda cards.  The tableau consists of
six flower beds in two rows above and a Koi pond below with the
foundations at the top.  Cards build from first to fourth rank
on the tableau by suit and from fourth to first on the foundations.
Only first rank cards may be played on an empty row.  No more than
six cards may be played on a row.  Cards may be moved from the Koi
pond to either the rows or the foundations but may not be moved to
the pond.  Only one card may be moved at a time.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
It's not at all unusual to have no possible moves after dropping
cards to the foundations.  Try to get an open row.
