<h1>Doublets</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards except the four Kings to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>

The base rank for the foundation is determined at game start,
and it builds up by doubling the rank ignoring suit:
<p>
A, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, Q, J, 9, 5, 10, 7, A, repeat...

The 7 reserve piles are automatically filled from the waste or talon.

are put at the bottom of the talon during game start.
