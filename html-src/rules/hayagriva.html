<h1>Hayagriva</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank only on the tableau, no more
than twelve to a row.  Only the Rajas may be played on an empty row.
<h3>Rules</h3>
All cards are dealt to the sixteen rows when the games begins.  Cards
on the tableau build down in rank only.  The foundations build up by suit.
Only a Raja or sequence may be played on an empty row.  The four reserve
stacks hold one card each.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
An empty row is somewhat more useful than the reserve stacks.  Try for an empty row.
