<h1>Snake (Die Schlange)</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>,
but with 2 decks, and empty rows are not filled.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt to 9 piles at the start of the game, each King
starting a new pile.
To compensate for this there are 7 free cells which can hold any
- and just one - card.
<p>
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space cannot be filled.
<p>
The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is a <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell type game</a> of German origin.
It is related to <a href="catstail.html">Cat's Tail</a>.
