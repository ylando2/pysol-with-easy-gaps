<h1>King Only Baker's Game</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="bakersgame.html">Baker's Game</a>,
but only Kings on empty spaces.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt at the start of the game. To compensate for this
there are 4 free cells which can hold any - and just one - card.
<p>
Piles build down by suit, and you can only move Kings to empty slots.
<p>
The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
