FreeCell type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="relaxedfreecell.html">Relaxed FreeCell</a>,
but with 2 decks, and empty rows are not filled.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All cards are dealt to 8 piles at the start of the game, each King
starting a new pile.
To compensate for this there are 8 free cells which can hold any
- and just one - card.
<p>
Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space cannot be filled.
