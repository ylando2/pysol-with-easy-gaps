<h1>Braid (Der Zopf)</h1>
<p>
Napoleon type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This game is somewhat harder and requires thoughtful strategy.
<p>
The layout consist of a Braid of 20 cards, two groups of four helper
fields, four braid fields (each showing a picture of a braid), the waste
pile, and the eight foundations.  The first card automatically dealt to a
Foundation sets the beginning value for all foundations, and an indicator
displays the value of that card.
<p>
You choose whether the sequences on the foundations will be ascending
or descending, and your choice is displayed in an indicator.  The choice is
made when you place the first card on a foundation which is not the
already-determined base card.
It must follow suit and must have a numerical value
of either one more or one less than the base card.  Ace is considered one
higher than King, and at the same time one less than Two.
<p>
You may place cards on the foundation from anywhere on the table,
including the end of the Braid.  The eight helper fields can be filled from
the waste pile but not from the Braid or the braid fields.  When you move
a card from a braid field to the foundation, that field is automatically
filled with the last card on the Braid itself.
<p>
In going through the talon, you are limited to three rounds, and an
indicator reports on that status.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
You can use the helper fields to temporarily store cards you expect to
use soon, and you can leave them open until the right card comes up from the
Talon.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This is a solitaire variant of German origin.
