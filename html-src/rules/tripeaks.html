<h1>Tri Peaks</h1>
<p>
Golf type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the waste stack.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Much like <a href="relaxedgolf.html">Relaxed Golf</a>,
only with a <a href="pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>
related layout.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Build singly on the waste stack up or down regardless of suit.
<p>
Only the top card is available for play. When no more moves are
possible, click on the talon to deal a new card.
<p>
Sequences wrap around,
i.e. Twos and Kings may be placed on Aces
and Queens and Aces may be placed on Kings.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
There is a simple scoring system here - you debit $120 for each game
($5 for each of the 24 cards in the talon) and for every card you
bear off, you get $1, $2, $3,... credit, depending on the length
of your current streak.
<br>
Each cleared peak gains $15 bonus, and there's an
additional $30 if you manage to clear all three peaks.
<br>
Your balance is reset whenever you select a different game.
Loaded games and manually entered game numbers don't count.
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.
