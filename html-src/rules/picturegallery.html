<h1>Picture Gallery (Die Bildgallerie)</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Fill the entire Gallery with pictures.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The layout consists of three rows of playing piles, a row for newly-
dealt cards, and a castoff pile for Aces.
<p>
All Aces are cast off to the pile on the right.  Use the &lt;A&gt; key.
When you clear a space on the tableau,
you can only fill it with the right card:
<ul>
<li>In the first row, you build up sequences starting with a Four,
<li>in the second row with a Three, and in the
<li>third row with a Two.
</ul>
You build up sequences incrementing by three, up to
the face cards.  Thus, in the first row, each pile is 4-7-10-K, in the
second row 3-6-9-D, and in the third row, 2-5-8-B. Once a sequence has been
started, you have to follow suit.
<p>
If you clear a space at the bottom it will get automatically filled
with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you clear a space
at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh row
of cards at the bottom.
<p>
You win when the entire Gallery is filled with pictures, that is, face cards.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires some
concentration, but it is not too hard to win.
