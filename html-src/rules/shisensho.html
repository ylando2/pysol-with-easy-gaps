<h1>Shisen-Sho</h1>
<p>
Shisen-Sho is a single-player-game similar to Mahjongg and uses the same
set of tiles as Mahjongg.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The aim of the game is to remove all tiles from the board. Only two
matching tiles can be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be removed if they
can be connected with a maximum of three connected lines. Lines can be
horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.
<p>
You don't have to draw the lines by yourself, the game does this for
you. Just mark two matching tiles on the board, if they can be connected with a
maximum of three lines, the lines will be drawn and the tiles are
removed.
<p>
Remember that lines only may cross the empty border. If you are stuck, you
can use the Hint feature to find two tiles which may be removed. Clicking a
tile with the right mouse button will show you all corresponding tiles, no
matter if they are removable at the moment or not.
