This game is one of a series of games that have names ending in "pati"
which transliterates as "lord of".  Tipati means "Lord (Highest/Queen) of
Women".  The names are the names of the suits in a twelve suit Ganjifa deck.

Move cards back and forth on the rows to make every play possible.
Don't let the waste stack get too deep.
