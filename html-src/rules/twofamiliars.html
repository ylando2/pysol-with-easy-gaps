<h1>Two Familiars</h1>
Klondike type. Two decks. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the Foundations.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
This is a two deck version of <a href="thefamiliar.html">The Familiar</a>.

<h3>Rules</h3>
Game play is like Klondike.  The rows build down in rank in alternate
color.  The color of the Wizards is the alternate of either red or black.
Only the Tens (top rank cards) may be played on an empty row.  There is
one reserve stack that will hold up to three Wizards.  No suit cards can
be played there.  The Wizards will also play in their proper rank position
on the tableau.  They play as the alternate of either red or black.  Cards
are dealt from the talon one at a time.  Cards may be played from the
foundations.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Use caution when playing the Wizards on the reserve stack.  If you play a
lower rank Wizard on top of a higher rank one, you will have to move it off
before the high rank one will play to the foundation.
