<h1>Glenwood</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. One redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The first item of play is to select an available card for the first
Foundation. Once selected, all other Foundations must also start with this
value.
<p>
Foundations are built up by suit, wrapping from King to Ace where necessary.
Once a card is placed on a Foundation pile, it is out of play.
<p>
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Whole piles of cards
can be moved on to another Tableau pile. Empty slots in the Tableau can be
filled by any available card in the Reserves or, if all the Reserves are
empty, from the Waste.
<p>
Cards are flipped singly from Stock to Waste. There is one redeal.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Be careful when selecting your first Foundation pile. Try to get the cards out
of the Reserves as early as possible. Sometimes keeping cards in play is more
important than moving them to the Foundation.
