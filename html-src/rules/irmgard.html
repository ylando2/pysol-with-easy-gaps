<h1>Irmgard</h1>
<p>
Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>,
but 9 piles and only Kings on empty spaces.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The playing piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space
can only be filled by a King or a sequence starting with a King.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, click on the talon.  One card will be
added to each of the playing piles, except for the last turn where only
7 cards will be dealt.
<p>
You are also permitted to move cards back out of the foundation.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
As with Gypsy you are allowed to make heavy use of the Undo key.
