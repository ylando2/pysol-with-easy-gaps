<h1>Fortune's Favor</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>
Fortune's Favor is a solitaire card game which is playing with a deck of 52
playing cards. It is so-called probably because the chances of winning are
completely on the player's side.
<p>
First, the four aces are removed from the deck and placed in a row to form the
bases of the foundations. These foundations are built up by suit to kings.
<p>
Below the foundations, two rows of six cards each (or any preferred
arrangement of twelve cards) are dealt. These form the bases of the twelve
tableau piles. The top cards on the tableau piles are available for building
on the foundations and on the tableau. Building in the tableau is down by suit
and spaces which result in moving a card is filled from the wastepile or, if
there is none, the stock. Only one card can be moved at a time.
<p>
The stock, when play goes on a standstill, is dealt one card at a time onto a
wastepile, the top card of which is available for play on the tableau or
foundations.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations.
