==================================================================

PySol is an exciting collection of more than 200 solitaire games.


Introduction
------------
  Please see the HTML documentation `data/html/intro.html'
  for an overview of the many features.

  For other questions like "how do I install PySol ?" and "how to play ?"
  also consult the HTML documentation in the `data/html' directory.


Feedback
--------
  As I do not have the time to test all variants thoroughly this
  release will have bugs and misfeatures. The only way to get
  these fixed is to report them.

  I also welcome your comments and suggestions (or just a mail
  that you like PySol :-)
